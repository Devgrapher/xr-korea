## Prerequisites

If you do not have the Gatsby CLI installed yet, do it first.

```bash
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```

The Gatsby CLI uses Node and npm which you will also need installed. More information can be found on [GatsbyJS.org](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-one/).

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Install the starter using the Gatsby new command.

```bash
gatsby new landing-page https://github.com/gillkyle/gatsby-starter-landing-page.git
```

Navigate into the project directory and launch the site.

```bash
cd landing-page && gatsby develop
```

The site will be opened up in your default browser on http://localhost:8000

Edit code in the `/src`, save your changes, and they'll reload instantly in the browser.

## ðŸ’« Deploy

If you just want to see a site online real fast you can deploy a copy of the site to Netlify with this button.

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/devgrapher/xr-korea)

To create an optimized build of the site run this command

```bash
gatsby build
```

A `/public` folder will be assembled that can be deployed to a service like Netlify, Surge, GitHub Pages, AWS S3, Firebase hosting, or your own file server.
